- rewrite all tests that use extract.docs.file to use the new 
  extract.docs.lines if there is no need to actually write something
  this will speed up the tests 
- unify the running of the tests
  - make it possible to run isolated tests and normla RUnit tests together 
  - convert the original  tests by inlinedocs to either RUnit or our  
    isolated extension
- change the alias (and possibly file name) convention for Rd files of 
  S4 methods. In order to work properly together with method? and class?
  there is a naming convention for the alias to be met.
  e.g.:"f.numeric.ANY-mehtod"
  (see writing R extensions S4 classes and Methods)
	At the moment we have something like f__method_numeric_ANY
- remove the Namespace only flag from the code
  The default behaviour should be to always only document the exported functions classes or methods
  If one wants to document a function temporarily one can always add it to the Namespace
  and remove it from there before releasing the package.

 create tests for the example extraction for all type of documentable objects
 At the moment only methods and normal functions are tested
 classes and generics are not
